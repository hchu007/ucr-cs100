# Introduction to the BASH Command Line

Purpose of this lab
------------------------------------
This lab will familiarize CS 100 students with the command line as they transition from using visual displays on Windows and OS X to the Linux BASH shell.

Introduction
------------------------------------
Only 1.41% of all desktop and laptop computers run Linux as the primary operating system. That means you probably don't have too much experience with Linux either. 

Linux programmers primarily use the command line to interact with the computer and this may seem foreign to Windows and Mac users. 

By the end of this lab, you will be able to execute basic commands in the BASH terminal to create, move, and delete files and directories, as well as a few other useful functions.
